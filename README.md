# Mission to Mars with Web Scraping

### Background

A junior data scientist Robin does freelance astronomy work in her spare time. Her dream is to land a position with NASA someday. So she spends a lot of time visiting sites with news about space exploration, especially the Mission to Mars. In this project, I used web scraping techniques to help her gather all the information she searches for into one convenient location.

### A web application with a button that will scrape new data every time Robin tells it to:
- Use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
- Create a MongoDB database to store data from the web scrape.
-	Create a web application with Flask to display the data from the web scrape.
- Create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase projects.
-	Use Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio.

### Scrape the following information into the app:
-	The latest Mars news with title and a brief paragraph.
-	The featured Mars image.
-	Mars Facts table.

### For this challenge, I conducted following additional steps to build the app:
-	Scrape full-resolution Mars Hemisphere images and titles.
-	Update the Web app with Marsâ€™s Hemisphere images and titles.
-	Add Bootstrap 3 components:
    1.	Make the website mobile-responsive.
    2.	Change button color.
    3.	Change Mars Hemisphere images to circled shape.
